## ✨ What Is This?

This is a **daily journaling and reflection system** built as a custom skill for [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code). It helps you:

- 📊 Track mood and energy patterns over time
- ✅ Monitor accomplishment momentum and priority completion
- ⏰ Analyze how you spend your time (Work, Learning, Rest, Social, Wasted)
- 🔍 Identify correlations between activities and well-being (e.g., "Gym days = +2 mood points")
- 🧠 Build self-awareness through consistent reflection
- 💬 Receive encouraging, non-judgmental AI-generated insights
- 🎯 Maintain accountability loops for your goals

**Time commitment:** 5-10 minutes per day
**Philosophy:** Progress over perfection. Rest and productivity can coexist.

## 📖 How It Works

### The Daily Flow

1. **Date Selection** - Fill out for today or backfill previous days
2. **Mode Selection** - Quick (5 min) or Full (8-10 min)
3. **Yesterday's Priority Check** - Did you complete it? (Accountability loop)
4. **Mood & Energy** - Quick multiple choice
5. **3 Accomplishments** - What did you do today?
6. **Tomorrow's #1 Priority** - What matters most?
7. **Tags** - What type of day was it? (Work, Learning, Rest, Social, Recovery, Gym)
8. **Time Allocation** - Hours in: Work, Learning, Rest, Social, Wasted
9. **Gratitude** - What are you grateful for?
10. **Rotating Question** - Changes by day of week (Full mode only)

### What You Get

After each check-in, an AI agent generates a comprehensive reflection including:

- **TL;DR** - Scannable summary (< 100 words)
- **Mood & Energy Patterns** - Trends with ASCII charts
- **Accomplishment Momentum** - Celebration of wins
